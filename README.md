# dice-roll-game-python
Built a multiplayer dice game in Python for 2â€“4 players. The game features turn-based logic, score tracking, input validation, and random dice rolls. Players take risks each turn to build their score, but rolling a 1 ends their turn with zero points. The first player to reach 50 wins.
